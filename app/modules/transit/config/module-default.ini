help[] = "Find out when the bus is coming with real-time tracking. See the buses in service by clicking on the ‘Running’ tab. Clicking a name of the route takes you to a page that shows a map view and the list of stops. Using live tracking, the map view displays the current location of each shuttle, represented by a drop pin, while dots mark stops along the route. Clicking a name of a stop in the list of the stops takes you to a stop detail screen that shows you the list of shuttles serving that location."

help[] = "The list view also shows the next scheduled stop on the route. To update the shuttle position, click the ‘Refresh’ link near the top of the page or use your web browser's ‘Refresh’ command."

help[] = "Buses not in service are listed under the ‘Offline’ tab, where you can view schedules and route maps. Read service announcements by clicking the ‘News’ tab, and find calendar and general schedule information, as well as shuttle service phone numbers, on the ‘Info’ tab."
